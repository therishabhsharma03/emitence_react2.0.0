This initiative promises to revolutionize connectivity and spur economic growth in the region.
    <h3>Enhancing Connectivity: Ahmedabad to Dholera</h3>

      <li>Tailored for Urban Commuting: The metro service aims to provide seamless connectivity within a 100 km radius, catering to daily commuters and facilitating easy access to key industrial areas.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Infrastructure Development and Economic Growth</h3>
    The proposal for the Vande Metro has been submitted to the Ministry of Railways, and a detailed feasibility report is in progress. The development of social and other infrastructure is crucial for Dholera’s growth. With major companies establishing their presence, there will be an increase in employment opportunities and a boost in local services.
    The state government is also investing heavily in infrastructure such as highways and airports, expected to be completed within the next year.
